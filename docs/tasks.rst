.. _async:

async()
-------

Use :func:`async` from your code to quickly offload tasks to the :class:`Cluster`:

.. code:: python

    from django_q.tasks import async, result

    # create the task
    async('math.copysign', 2, -2)

    # or with import and storing the id
    import math.copysign

    task_id = async(copysign, 2, -2)

    # get the result
    task_result = result(task_id)

    # result returns None if the task has not been executed yet
    # you can wait for it
    task_result = result(task_id, 200)

    # but in most cases you will want to use a hook:

    async('math.modf', 2.5, hook='hooks.print_result')

    # hooks.py
    def print_result(task):
        print(task.result)

:func:`async` can take the following optional keyword arguments:

hook
""""
The function to call after the task has been executed. This function gets passed the complete :class:`Task` object as its argument.

group
"""""
A group label. Check :doc:`group` for group functions.

save
""""
Overrides the result backend's save setting for this task.

timeout
"""""""
Overrides the cluster's timeout setting for this task.

sync
""""
Simulates a task execution synchronously. Useful for testing.
Can also be forced globally via the :ref:`sync` configuration option.

cached
""""""
Redirects the result to the cache backend instead of the database if set to ``True`` or to an integer indicating the cache timeout in seconds.
e.g. ``cached=60``. Especially useful with large and group operations where you don't need the all results in your
database and want to take advantage of the speed of your cache backend.

broker
""""""
A broker instance, in case you want to control your own connections.

task_name
"""""""""

Optionally overwrites the auto-generated task name.

q_options
"""""""""
None of the option keywords get passed on to the task function.
As an alternative you can also put them in
a single keyword dict named ``q_options``. This enables you to use these keywords for your function call::

    # Async options in a dict

    opts = {'hook': 'hooks.print_result',
            'group': 'math',
            'timeout': 30}

    async('math.modf', 2.5, q_options=opts)

Please note that this will override any other option keywords.

.. note::
    For tasks to be processed you will need to have a worker cluster running in the background using ``python manage.py qcluster``
    or you need to configure Django Q to run in synchronous mode for testing using the :ref:`sync` option.


Async
-----

Optionally you can use the :class:`Async` class to instantiate a task and keep everything in a single object.:

.. code-block:: python

    # Async class instance example
    from django_q.tasks import Async

    # instantiate an async task
    a = Async('math.floor', 1.5, group='math')

    # you can set or change keywords afterwards
    a.cached = True

    # run it
    a.run()

    # wait indefinitely for the result and print it
    print(a.result(wait=-1))

    # change the args
    a.args = (2.5,)

    # run it again
    a.run()

    # wait max 10 seconds for the result and print it

    print(a.result(wait=10))

.. code-block:: python

    1
    2

Once you change any of the parameters of the task after it has run, the result is invalidated and you will have to :func:`Async.run` it again to retrieve a new result.

Cached operations
-----------------
You can run your tasks results against the Django cache backend instead of the database backend by either using the global :ref:`cached` setting or by supplying the ``cached`` keyword to individual functions.
This can be useful if you are not interested in persistent results or if you run large group tasks where you only want the final result.
By using a cache backend like Redis or Memcached you can speed up access to your task results significantly compared to a relational database.

When you set ``cached=True``, results will be saved permanently in the cache and you will have to rely on your backend's cleanup strategies (like LRU) to
manage stale results.
You can also opt to set a manual timeout on the results, by setting e.g. ``cached=60``. Meaning the result will be evicted from the cache after 60 seconds.
This works both globally or on individual async executions.::

    # simple cached example
    from django_q.tasks import async, result

    # cache the result for 10 seconds
    id = async('math.floor', 100, cached=10)

    # wait max 50ms for the result to appear in the cache
    result(id, wait=50, cached=True)

    # or fetch the task object
    task = fetch(id, cached=True)

    # and then save it to the database
    task.save()

As you can see you can easily turn a cached result into a permanent database result by calling ``save()`` on it.

This also works for group actions::

    # cached group example
    from django_q.tasks import async, result_group
    from django_q.brokers import get_broker

    # set up a broker instance for better performance
    broker = get_broker()

    # async a hundred functions under a group label
    for i in range(100):
        async('math.frexp',
              i,
              group='frexp',
              cached=True,
              broker=broker)

    # wait max 50ms for one hundred results to return
    result_group('frexp', wait=50, count=100, cached=True)

If you don't need hooks, that exact same result can be achieved by using the more convenient :func:`async_iter`.

Synchronous testing
-------------------

:func:`async` can be instructed to execute a task immediately by setting the optional keyword ``sync=True``.
The task will then be injected straight into a worker and the result saved by a monitor instance::

    from django_q.tasks import async, fetch

    # create a synchronous task
    task_id = async('my.buggy.code', sync=True)

    # the task will then be available immediately
    task = fetch(task_id)

    # and can be examined
    if not task.success:
        print('An error occurred: {}'.format(task.result))

.. code:: bash

    An error occurred: ImportError("No module named 'my'",)

Note that :func:`async` will block until the task is executed and saved. This feature bypasses the broker and is intended for debugging and development.
Instead of setting ``sync`` on each individual ``async`` you can also configure :ref:`sync` as a global override.

Connection pooling
------------------

Django Q tries to pass broker instances around its parts as much as possible to save you from running out of connections.
When you are making individual calls to :func:`async` a lot though, it can help to set up a broker to reuse for :func:`async`:

.. code:: python

    # broker connection economy example
    from django_q.tasks import async
    from django_q.brokers import get_broker

    broker = get_broker()
    for i in range(50):
        async('math.modf', 2.5, broker=broker)

.. tip::

    If you are using `django-redis <https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis>`__  and the redis broker, you can :ref:`configure <django_redis>` Django Q to use its connection pool.
